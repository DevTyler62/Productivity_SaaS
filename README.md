# Pathway to Productivity

A fully responsive landing page built for a SaaS company. Showcasing the mission of the product, what companies currently use it, features of the product, and what customers have been saying about it.

This landing page was built off of a Figma design. It was built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

The page is hosted using vercel and can be found at this link: https://productivity-saas.vercel.app/
